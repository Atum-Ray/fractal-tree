### Example Design

### Version
0.1.0

### Changelog

v0.1.0
  - Correctly loads fractal tree to screen canvas
  - Produces text display of main variables used in design
  - Fails whenever canvas size is changed

### TODO
  - Fix canvas resize function
  - Render canvas to full size of HTML body
  - Separate functions and default variable values by file; give JS files better names
  - Improve variable display, iterate over objects used
  - Adjust line width and branch length according to generation of line drawn
  - Establish computational limits to prevent variables from being too large as to break
  - Add JQuery inputs to change variables in real-time without page reload
  - Get better scaling function which automatically adjusts to fit page no matter what the fractal tree design
  - Provide better commenting
  - Real-time code editing (if possible)
